## How combat works

When two enemy carriers meet at a star, a combat takes place.

Combats are fought automatically and are instant. A summary of the battle is placed in your event log to review next time you log in.

If two players approach an unoccupied star and are due to arrive at the same time, the ship that has traveled the shortest distance will claim the star first and will receive the defenders bonus

The defender is the player who owns the star at the time of the combat. The defender strikes first and with +1 Weapons Tech bonus.

Starting with the defender, each player takes turns destroying enemy ships until only one player has ships remaining.

Each player destroys a number of ships equal to their Weapons Technology each round.

When players have more than one carrier in combat, damage is applied roughly evenly to each carrier involved.

Working out who will win a combat can be difficult to guess so the top of the carrier and star inspector windows is a battle calculator. It will help you predict the outcome of battles. Simply enter the number of ships and the weapons technology you think each player will have.

## Example
Defender has 4 weapons technology (+1 for defending) and 10 ships. Attacker has 6 weapons technology and 10 ships.

Round 1: defender does 5 damage, attacker loses 5 ships leaving 5 ships.

Round 2: attacker does 6 damage, defender loses 6 ships leaving 4 ships.

Round 3: defender does 5 damage, attacker loses 5 ships leaving 0 ships.

Defender wins with 4 ships remaining!
